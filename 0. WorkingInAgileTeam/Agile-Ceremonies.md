üìù Reflection

1. How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
   By publishing and sharing the milestones, process and updates with the team regularly, it helps the team understand deeper to communicate based on previous alignment through meetings.

2. Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
   I personally think daily standups and sprint planning are important for my role as a React Native developer. With daily standups, I could share my process and frustration to other members and supervisor which could potential help me receiving different ideas and perspectives. Besides that, attending and understand sprint planning can give me hands-in experience about agile medothologies within real company which equips me suitable knowledge.
