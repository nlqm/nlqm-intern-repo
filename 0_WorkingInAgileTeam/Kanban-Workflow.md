üìù Reflection
1. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
- By seperating clearly each task to specific category, Kanban helps me understand the type of the task and from their easily priorty tasks to avoid overload by not able to specify which tasks to complete first. 

2. How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
- Understanding the task description and the category that task belong to divide them in suitable group helps me know which group of task should prioritise and arrange the working flow to suit with my working preferences.

3.  Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
- Receive the task and organise it into the corresponding group, then review every task once again to create the suitable working flow.
