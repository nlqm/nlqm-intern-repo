ðŸ“Œ Which AI tools did you try?
- I tried ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for web development. I have not tried claudeAi yet.

ðŸ“Œ What worked well? What didnâ€™t?
- From my own experience I see ChatGPT works better than Copilot if I give it deeper information and data such as the current code. 

ðŸ“Œ When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
- When you do not have things and want to create the project from scratch, AI could be the tool to help you quickly started and avoid the fear of "blank-space". AI could also help you understand some concepts that you havent experienced before. Giving some potential solution is another advantage of AI but double checking is also required in order to utilise those knowledge rather than purely copy and paste behaviours.
