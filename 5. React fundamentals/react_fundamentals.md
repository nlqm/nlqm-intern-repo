Setting up a React project #29

Understanding Components & Props #28
ðŸ“Œ Why are components important in React?
By creating components, it is easier to reuse components. Especially with dynamic props within component, coders can quickly pass the value and avoid code repetition.

Handling State & User Input #27
ðŸ“Œ What happens if we modify state directly instead of using setState?
if we use setState, the number of count variable is changed but there is no reload within the app therefore the UI won't update the changes. By using useState and update the props dynamically, the app will be re-rendered and show the changes.

ðŸ“Œ What are some potential pitfalls?
One of the biggest pitfalls I have faced is hard to understand because the class name will get long, messy and hard to understand.
