Implementing Internationalization with i18next #17
ðŸ“Œ What challenges did you face while setting up i18next?
The learning curve for this is really high, especially how to setup the environment and the required files for it to work properly. File management for keeping multiple languages in separate JSON file could be a problem when the app grow. Because using JSON file to store translation data, updating and managing those information could be time consuming and hard to by compatible with dynamic content issues.

ðŸ“Œ Why is it important to use a library like i18next instead of manually handling translations?
Comparing to manual translations by writing conditions to translate, i18next is easier to manage, better code maintainability because the translation does not attach within the UI, dynamically updating the translation part rather than reloading the whole page and provides falling back to default language when issues appear.

ðŸ“Œ How would you handle dynamic content (e.g., user-generated text) in a multilingual app?
From my perspective, the user-generated text from users should be separated to avoid wrong translations happen. In order to translate dynamic content, using some external translation services such as Google Translate will be the big help based on my research. Providing user the option to translate the dynamic content such as in Instagram app will be more efficient as well.
