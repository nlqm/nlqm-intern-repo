Understanding React Native components vs React components #77

ðŸ“Œ What are the key differences between <View> and <div>?
View in React Native is used to map to a view of iOS or Android device screen while div is rendered for HTML web page. Their default flex direction are different as well: React Native will flex in column by default while React default flex direction is row. The big difference between these two are pseudo classes support: React Native does not support pseudo classes while React is fully support it with CSS styling. Fundamentally, those 2 are designer for different environment, 1 is for mobile optimization with touch gestures while other is for web interactions.

ðŸ“Œ How does StyleSheet.create() improve performance compared to inline style?
I does not used these 2 methods so I am not sure about the performance differences. I did try create the app and compare and the differences based on my experience are: StyleSheet support style reusability while inline style need more time to load and cannot be reused and increase duplication.

ðŸ“Œ Why doesn't React Native use className like React web?
They actually do! After installing NativeWind to be able to use TailwindCSS within React Native project! I did included some images within this React Native fundamental folder. NativeWind is the styling libraries and this is the website I use for installation: https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/installation 
To answer the original question, React Native does not support traditional CSS so it avoid using className component.
