Performance Optimization in React Native #68
ðŸ“Œ What are the most common performance issues in React Native?
Due to my research, some React Native performance issues could be caused by updating components too often cause unnecessary re-renders, doing complicated calculations, using images that have not optimized yet, and functions require a lot of time to load therefore freeze the web.

ðŸ“Œ How do useMemo and useCallback improve performance?
By using useMemo and useCallback, we could avoid recalculating complicated values unless the dependencies change and prevent unnecessary re-creation with memoized functions.

ðŸ“Œ What tools can you use to measure and monitor app performance?
From my personal experience, the tool I used was Sentry. It provides the details of the bugs and web performance with the screen recording which helps me understand the problems better.
