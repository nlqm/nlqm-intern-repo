üìù Reflection

    1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
    - I experienced within my old company. By being transaprent about deadlines, task, expectations and problems, the team could be more effective with respect communication. Responsibility avoiding is a thing that must be avoided.

    2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
    - Ensure that I understand the issue or the concept of the story before attending the conflict. Notifying managers if violent or serious problems happened. Always being respectful and openminded to listen to other ideas.

    3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
    - Treating everyone with respect, appreciation and kindness. Providing feedback with care and thinking for others to understand their cases before commiting my actions.
