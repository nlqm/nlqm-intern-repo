üìù Reflection

    1. When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
    - When I get stuck after trying my best to do it. I always try my best and do it by myself before asking AI for help.

    2. How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
    - Understanding the issues and the solution that AI provided before applying it, I will try to write the code by myself after understand the solution from AI.

    3. What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
    - Avoid copying all the code or data to AI to avoid data leak. Changing all names of confidental data before providing it to AI.
