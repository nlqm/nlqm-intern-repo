Identifying & Fixing Code Smells #34

ðŸ“Œ What code smells did you find in your code?
During my old university projects, there are some code smells that I left in my code such as long functions, large classes, and deep nested conditions. After project updates with my other team mates and they brought that up, I ensured that I fixed immediately.

ðŸ“Œ How did refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of the code?
Personally, I think reducing code smells will help the programs easier to understand, update and increase project scalability. It is also extremely helpful when working in a team because you are not the person wrote that code. Clean code with less code smells helps you rapidly understand and pick up the work.

ðŸ“Œ How can avoiding code smells make future debugging easier?
It is easier to maintain and debug the simple code comparing to overcomplicated program. For example, if you encounter a bug that need to update some values, editing constants and automatically updating the rest will be more quick and efficient comparing to manually fix each value.
