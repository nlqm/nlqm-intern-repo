Reflection Questions

    1. What was your first impression of the app?
    - I feel like the app is hard to use because I didnt aware of the onboarding experience when I access it on my Window the first time. The app also opened too many windows at the same time and its hard to know which window is the main one and therefore getting lose.

    2. Did you find anything difficult to understand?
    - Form my personal experience, it was hard for me to know that I have to set up my habit first before using the app. The current UI is neat but its confused sometimes cuh as the customise my habits button is a link instead of a button.

    3. If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?
    - Its a focus and profuctivity app which blocks your social accounts to ensure you spend time doing actually work instead.

    4. What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?
    - I think redesign the app UI to ensure it consistent and easier to realise the important features are the changes that FB could make rn.
