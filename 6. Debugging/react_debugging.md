Research Best Debugging Techniques for React #32

ðŸ“Œ What are the most common debugging techniques?
Some common debugging techniques that I use are: console logging with the integration of Chrome Dev Tool to observe the changes, use breakpoint when needed, understand the structure of the component to understand the data flow and find the issue from there. One more technique that I learnt through the research is based on component rendering times to find the performance pain points that can improve.

ðŸ“Œ Which tools are most effective for React debugging?
Chrome DevTools is the tool I use the most because of its convenience. I also knew about React Developer plugin that help me inspect the component flow, props, states and component rendering performance. Visual Studio Code also offer built-in debugger but I have not favoured them that much. I also had a short trial with Sentry, it provided real-time error tracking with the screen recording helps me quickly identify the issues with clear evidence and context.

ðŸ“Œ How do you debug issues in large React codebases?
I will ensure that the React application satisfy is already broken down into smaller components with separate and unique functions, following clean code and code style guidelines. Creating test cases and implementing them into the component to tackle the issues after identifying the problem by reading and understanding the warning provided by React. Reviewing code and communicating with others about the issues if I cannot personally solve it is my last option after failing to try fixing bugs by myself.
