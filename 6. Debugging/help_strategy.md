When you get stuck - what next? #31

ðŸ“Œ When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
Normally I will try to understand the bug first and find the key word about that, put them on Youtube to find the tutorials to debug if possible. If I could not find any tutorials on Youtube I will search on Google to find the related blogs or documentation to help me understand deeper and know how to fix it. I wont provide confidential data to AI and prefer searching Google to find some clues.

ðŸ“Œ How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
After trying everything by myself but it does not work including researching on Google, documentation and asking AI when the information is not confidential, I will ask the colleague and share what I have tried.

ðŸ“Œ What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
The biggest challenge is they can not see the problem in different perspective because they have spent too many time looking at those bugs. Asking for another person's view could bring different insights or escaping it for a while and then come back with a fresh mind.
